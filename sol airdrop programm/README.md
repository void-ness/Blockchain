Hey everyone! this is a simple airdropping project. the basic aim of the project is to create a wallet having public and secret key, fetch its balance, then airdrop 2 solanas into the wallet and then fetch the updated balance. all the requests for checking the balance and airdropping the sols are done on the devnet provided by solana, which is commonly used by developers for testing as the "mainnet" is paid.
